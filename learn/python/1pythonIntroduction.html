                    <p>Python is a high-level programming language and very popular language.</p>
                    <p class="features">Some Features of Python:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Python is an interpreted language, which means that it is not compiled to machine code before it is executed. This makes it easier to develop and debug programs, but it can also make the programs run slower than they would if they were compiled
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It is easy to learn and use, with a simple and readable syntax which makes it a good language for beginners.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis and artificial intelligence.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It allows programming in Object-Oriented and Procedural paradigms.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Generally, Python codes are smaller than other programming languages.
